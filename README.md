# SMCS Archives Manager
A file manager and downloader. Allows tracking of files for accession and uploading to a remote database.
As this project gets closer to completion, this repo will be updated with database specs, so that anyone may use this
software.


Thanks to @Devtography, for providing a working boilerplate for React/Electron! View his project [here](https://github.com/Devtography/electron-react-typescript-webpack-boilerplate/).

## Getting started
```sh
// execute
git clone https://github.com/dmf444/ArchiveManager.git
```

Then install all the `node_modules` needed by executing the following command:
```sh
cd ArchiveManager\
npm install
```

Finally execute the following command to start Webpack in development mode and
watch the changes on source files for live rebuild on code changes.
```sh
npm run dev
```

The `npm run dev` command won't start your app and get your app shows on the
screen. To start your app, execute the following command:
```sh
npm start
```
